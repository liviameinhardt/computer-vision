    "## Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repetition Interpolation:**\n",
    "   This method simply repeats the previous frame to fill in the intermediate frames, resulting in a playback that appears \"stuttered\" since the intermediate frames do not contain new motion information. Thus, this method is very simple and causes some visual discomfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Interpolation:**\n",
    "   Linear interpolation calculates the intermediate frames as a weighted combination of the previous and subsequent frames, producing smooth transitions between frames, resulting in smoother playback than repetition interpolation. However, if there are fast or complex movements, we notice a blur/lag in the image since the movement is not uniform between the frames in reality. For example, in the Buster Keaton video, we can see the hand in two positions at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optical Flow Interpolation:**\n",
    "   Optical flow interpolation uses optical flow to estimate the movement of pixels between two consecutive frames and then adjusts the pixel coordinates to create more precise intermediate frames. In tests, the result was very similar to linear interpolation, presenting the same sensation of blur or lag in the image at times, especially when the movement was more complex. Additionally, it showed failures not seen in the other methods, such as the appearance of black spots in the corners of the image."

    "Suppose the following scenario: the pinhole camera captures a video while moving horizontally at a constant speed $ v_{\\text{cam}} $. A fixed object (a tree, for example) is at a distance $ d $ from the image plane (the plane containing the sensors). The camera generates a video at 60 frames per second, and the distance from the camera's aperture (pinhole) to the image plane (focal distance) is $ f $."

This means that for very distant objects, such as the Moon or the stars, the apparent movement in the image captured by the camera due to the horizontal displacement of the camera is imperceptible. These objects appear fixed in the camera's field of view. When we observe the Moon or the stars, even when moving laterally, these objects appear fixed in the sky. This is exactly what the optical flow analysis suggests – the apparent displacement of the points (optical flow) becomes practically zero. In other words, this result is consistent with our expectations.\n",
