# Computer Vision

Small projects developed for the Computer Vision Course at FGV EMAp; 
We followed  the [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://szeliski.org/Book/) book.


## Course Syllabus

Basic concepts of digital images: image formation, camera models, projective geometry, quantization, color, image transformations, filters, Fourier and wavelets. Computer vision before the intensive use of neural networks: filtering, edge detection, color histograms, stereo, segmentation, optical flow. Impact of neural networks on computer vision.
